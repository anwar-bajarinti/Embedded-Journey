👋 Welcome to My Embedded Systems Journey (Arduino Mega)

This repository contains my practice projects, experiments, and mini-tasks using Arduino Mega and other microcontrollers.
All the code here is part of my learning under the guidance of Balajee Sir.
📌 Note
You're welcome to **view and copy** this code for your own learning.
But please try to **customize or improve** the code instead of directly copying it.  
These projects are part of my personal and academic growth — your support and respect are appreciated 🙏

Thanks for visiting!
